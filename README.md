# DNAProcesses

I created this application to demonstrate the use of mulitple threads in c++ and what diminishing returns there are, if any,
when you increase the number of threads that the application uses.

This application also demonstrates how to access variables in a safe way from multiple threads "at the same time" using mutexes.

The repository has two branches, not including the master branch. One of the branches is used to show the application running on only one thread and the other branch utilises multiple threads.
