# DNAProcesses

I created this application to demonstrate the use of mulitple threads in c++ and what diminishing returns there are, if any,
when you increase the number of threads that the application uses.

This application also demonstrates how to access variables in a safe way from multiple threads "at the same time" using mutexes.
